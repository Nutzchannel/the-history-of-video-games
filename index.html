            <p>Modern-day electronic gaming all began back in circa 1958, where
            physicist William Higinbotham created <em>Tennis for Two,</em> a Pong-like
            game which utilitized an oscilloscope to display graphics. It was controlled
            by a chunky metallic box with a knob, for trajectory, and a button,
            for hitting the ball.</p>

            <p>Years later, in 1972, consumer electronic company Magnavox released
            the first commercial video game console: the <i>Magnavox Odyssey.</i>
            Rather than rendering full-color graphics, the Odyssey only displayed
            white boxes that would come to life by placing an overlay on your TV screen.</p>

            <p>Now that video gaming had been publicized, companies like Atari, Inc.
            had decided to dip their toes into this newborn industry. Atari, Nintendo, and many other companies then released
            various arcade cabinets, spreading from arcades to restaraunts to just
            about anywhere. Some famous games of this day included <em>Donkey Kong</em>
            and <em>Pong</em>.</p>

            <p>Video game companies were already booming, some companies had dreams
            of bringing more video games to home environments, as technology had
            evolved far past the Odyssey. In 1977, Atari began this trend and trope
            with the Atari 2600. Unfortunately, this was near the time that
            the video game market took a turn for the worst with a giant market
            crash, with games like the infamous <em>E.T. the Extraterrestrial</em>
            declined in quality so intensely, it was unknown if video gaming would
            exist any longer. The later releases of Mattel's Intellivison in 1980
            and Coleco's ColecoVision barely helped scoop the industry of where it lied&mdash;the bottom of the barrel.</p>

        <article class="padded">
            <p>The industry was still reeling and reeking from 1983's crash that
            moderately-known company Nintendo tried their hand at home consoles.
            Come 1985, Nintendo would release the Nintendo Entertainment System <small>(or <i>Family Computer</i> in Asia)</small>.
            With the console came a cartridge containing two games in one: <i>Duck Hunt</i>, and <em>Super Mario Brothers</em>.
            Specifically, Super Mario Brothers was such a step up it near single-handedly
            saved all of the video game industry. This is where video games once again
            recieved hope; the NES gave it a purpose again.</p>

        <article class="padded">
            <p>Now that video gaming was known again, industry newbie NEC Corporation
            released the TurboGrafx-16 in 1987, a new step into 16-bit, higher quality games.
            Unfortunately, the TurboGrafx-16 died out in the US and Europe to a following in Japan.
            In 1990, though, now industry giant Nintendo released a brand new successor to the NES:
            the SNES, or Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Other companies had noticed this new tradition,
            and well-known company SEGA released the SEGA Genesis. This ended up being big
            competition, with the SNES; the SNES had games like <em>Super Mario World</em> and <em>Star Fox</em>,
            where the Genesis had <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> and an updated version of <i>Battletoads</i>.
            Unfortunately, as if the cheesy family sit-com of a console race wasn't complicated enough,
            Nintendo was developing a CD-ROM addon to the SNES with SONY, only for the deal to be called
            off, and SONY would later attempt to get back.</p>

            <p>In 1993, Atari tried to re-enter the console race with the Atari Jaguar.
            A new participant in the console race, the 3DO company, tried to trump
            the Jaguar with their only system, the 3DO, only to fail horribly due to it's $700
            price tag. In 1995, SEGA had released a successor to the Genesis, the SEGA Saturn.
            Also, in the same year, SONY attempted to finally get back at Nintendo with their
            release of the PlayStation. This new triumph of 3D games was a spash of cold water
            to Nintendo's face, and they released the Nintendo 64 in 1996. Their
            flagship title, <em>Super Mario 64</em>, recieved critical acclaim.</p>

            <p>SEGA was beginning to decline in the console department, releasing
            their final console, the Dreamcast, with games like <i>Jet Set Radio</i>, in 1998. Luckily, this didn't slow down their work in software alone.
            SONY had released the PlayStation 2, with the option to install the Linux operating system, with revolutionary games and critical acclaim.
            Nintendo released the GameCube, with a launch title <i>Luigi's Mansion</i>, which was recieved well,
            and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em>. Microsoft decided to enter
            the now decades-old race with the XBox, with hit FPS <i>Halo</i>.</p>

            <p>Microsoft opened the generation with the XBox 360 in 2005, a commonly-known successor to the Xbox.
            The Xbox 360, while offering remasters of Xbox games, also had a new medium: The Kinect, a body-controlled addon.
            SONY released a PlayStation 3, with continuations of the <i>Metal Gear</i> series, in 2006.
            The flagship of this generation, though, was Nintendo's Wii in November 2006, which sold over 101.59 million units as of September 2015.</p>

            <p>In late 2011, Nintendo released the Wii U, a continuation of the Wii,
            to mixed reviews and poor sales. SONY released the PlayStation 4, which
            sold the best in the generation as of so far, despite its lack of backwards
            compatibility. In 2013, the Xbox One was released by Microsoft, which was the second best
            with it's DRM problem, preventing a disc from being plated on more than one console.</p>
